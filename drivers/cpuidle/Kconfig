	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using an ACPI-enabled platform, you should say Y here.

	select IRQ_TIMINGS
	help
	  The mobile governor is based on irq timings measurements and
	  pattern research combined with the next timer. This governor
	  suits very well on embedded systems where the interrupts are
	  grouped on a single core and the power is the priority.
