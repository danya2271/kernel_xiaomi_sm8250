	  3D graphics driver for the Adreno family of GPUs from QTI.

	  boosting when there is a new frame ready to be rendered to the
	  display. The boost frequencies for this driver should be set so that
	  frame drops are near-zero at the boosted frequencies and power
	  consumption is minimized at said frequency combination.
